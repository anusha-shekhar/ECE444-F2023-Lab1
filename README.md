**NOTE:** you will see a number of "fix images" commits after the commits for Activity 3. These were done as I was running into issues with the images. I initially uploaded an incorrect picture for the Activity 3 image, but when I modified it and re-committed, the image was not updating on GitHub (attempted twice). Hence, I decided to rename all the images and re-commit and re-push, which fixed the error.
